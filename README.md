# Scuffed Jad

https://zantier.github.io/scuffed-jad/

This is a Unity project that builds to WebGL, and should run in most browsers on PC. It doesn't really work on mobile.

![A preview image, showing scuffed Jad performing a magic attack and the player praying "protect from magic"](preview.png?raw=true)

Practice prayer switching in the browser against an imitation TzTok-Jad from Old School Runescape.

Your health bar will show as green if you protected successfully.

You can't attack Jad.

### Controls

Click: move, and switch prayers

W, A, S, D, scroll: camera

E, R: hide/show prayer panel

### If you haven't played Runescape

Click anywhere on the ground to move around.

The 3 symbols in the bottom right are 3 prayers in the game called:
- Protect from Magic
- Protect from Missiles
- Protect from Melee

Click to activate them, and note that only 1 can be active at a time. These completely prevent you from
taking Magic, Ranged, and Melee damage, respectively. See if you can figure out the correct prayers to
activate, and get your health bar to appear green :). (You won't need Protect from Melee unless you stand
right next to Jad)
